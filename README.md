# School_District_Analysis

REPORT

According to the data found in the PyCitySchoolChallenge file, the district summary is not greatly affected. The only changes are that some of the percentage values are slightly lower than the original table. On the other hand, the school summary has a strong change in data in the passing rater percentages. The pass rate drops approximetely 30%. By removing the ninth gradersâ€™ math and reading scores, Thomas High School drops from being in the top 5 to being the school with the lowest passing rate at 65%. Removing the ninth grades affects the math and reading scores by producing tables that show 'NaN' for the value of 9th grade. Removing school spending value, scores by school size and scores by school type does not strongly affect the data. However math and reading scores do drop slightly.
